# ATools - FlyForFun resources editor

## Overview

ATools is a little software suite that I developed in order to replace Aeonsoft's tools:
* ModelEditor -> Cola
* SfxEditor -> SfxEditor
* GUIEditor -> Daisy
* GUIEditor_v19 -> (no equivalent)
* WorldEditor-> Beast
* ResEditor -> (no equivalent) 

What my tools have in addition:
* More beautiful and convenient interface
* More stable
* Less bugs
* Better rendering (antialiasing, Z-Buffer with better quality)
* Totally in french, english and german
* Custom keyboards shortcuts
* Lots of new features added
* The source code is available so you can fit all you need


## Build    
To compile you will need:
* Visual Studio 2019
